In a company where you’re safe from losing your jobs, there will be a part of the population who decides that working hard is not for them, which means that productivity goes down.In China, they have a specific term for government jobs, “体制内”, meaning, “within the system”. Because these jobs are safe regardless of the market, even if the salary is lower, they are considered desirable jobs. Often times, to get a government job, you need to first pass an exam before you can get a position. Then, you will have opportunities to gradually climb up.The good thing about this system is that anybody who makes it into higher levels of leadership all started from the bottom. Because only a certain amount of people can be promoted each time, you’re filtering out people from each level as they make their way higher. This means that anybody who has made it up to national level leadership positions have been in politics for a long time and outclassed all their co-workers to climb up to this position.But what about all the others who stop climbing at some point? Is there a way to incentivice them to do good work?If there isn’t a promotion opportunity, then there can only be exploration into other incentivizing areas, namely money, time, or recognition.Government jobs don’t pay very well, so setting KPIs for bonuses might be a way to increase productivity. Another one might be to offer additional holidays as a bonus, as flex holidays are also extremely limited for government jobs. Lastly, recognition and awards might be interesting as well, but this might lean more towards the promotion path, as the goal of the recognition would be to use it as a stepping stone to get to wherever you want to go next.Largely, basic incentives are very similar to normal jobs. The main difference is that you’re working mostly with carrots, and the main stick of firing people is not as readily available anymore.Alternatively, if we think outside the box a bit, there might be opportunities to build in incentives through gamification, including providing scores, leaderboards, and mini prizes to showcase and reward efforts." }, { "title": "How to better penalize delivery driver traffic violations", "url": "/posts/ST2-how-to-better-penalize-delivery-driver-traffic-violations/", "categories": "Stanton Thoughts", "tags": "", "date": "2025-08-15 15:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Another “Stanton Thought” conversation popped up this week, this time with a co-worker.As we were walking to lunch, we saw a delivery driver get stopped by a policeman. The policeman was telling the delivery driver to stop so he can issue him a ticket for driving on the sidewalk. The delivery driver was trying his best to get away, alternating between backing up and driving forward around the policeman, all while yelling that he’s going to be late soon. At the end, he manages to get away (I was super impressed) while the policeman speaks into his walkie talkie, stating the license plate of the moped.This episode started the conversation of how much pressure the delivery drivers have. They are timed by the platform, often pushing them to take shortcuts that are unsafe or on pathways not designed for mopeds. Penalties for late delivery is a couple deliveries, and a traffic violation ticket is similar.So is there a way to solve this? One of the potential problems is how much time is given per delivery. The system optimizes the delivery drivers for shorter routes. On the flip side, delivery drivers will try to optimize their routes by taking as many orders as possible, so they are technically pushing themselves to the limit.When we saw what was happening with the delivery driver and policeman, there were two thoughts. Firstly, it’s too bad that we have to be punishing the people who are trying so hard to make ends meet. Secondly, this is a bigger systematic problem that probably will not be solved by just punishing the riders.What if instead of punishing the riders directly, the police punished the companies behind the riders? Instead of trying to get 50 RMB per ticket, the tickets get consolidated into a larger ticket fining the company? Woudln’t that create a lot more incentive for the company to provide more structure and requirements into safety and road choice of these drivers? They have the data anyways, so they know exactly when each driver is going the wrong direction on a road, is traveling through pedestrian sidewalks, etc. Wouldn’t punishing the company make for a more impactful result?At the very least, if you punished the company, they would definitely do something about it, especially if you restricted them from turning around and apportioning the fines to the riders.Incentivize the powerful to change, don’t focus on the powerless." }, { "title": "Stanton Thoughts", "url": "/posts/stanton_thought/", "categories": "Stanton Thoughts", "tags": "", "date": "2025-08-13 15:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "A good friend of mine and I were chatting over beers this week and he suddenly said that he had a “Stanton Thought”. I was confused, because this is never a term that we’ve used together before.He started explaining that there needs to be more education and systems in place to protect against sexually transmitted diseases in China, especially for non-straight people. There is definitely a lack of information on this front and it’s even worst for non-straight people because many of them might still publicly be in the closet, meaning that they would not be able to ask about this in public hospital settings. We imagine the number of people with STIs, or HIV even, might be much higher than we think. And many people might just be living with it without knowing that today’s medical solutions, when implemented early enough, can minimize most of the risks around it.We started brainstorming ideas around apps that we could build, how to aggregate and post information, what systems could be set up in clinics or hospitals to help these people, etc. For example, at private hospitals, there are some triage nurses that knows how to ask the right questions to isolate the potential medical problem, but others will complete forget that there is a possibility that you are not straight, so would forgo any line of questioning that doesn’t not align with that reality.We also looked at all the reasons why this does not exist yet. Obviously, information is widely available today, so there’s no reason that people cannot find it. Are there risks to, let’s say, building an app with this information and pointing to the proper clinics? Why wouldn’t it exist out in the open? Well, in China, there’s more restriction around pride related stuff nowadays. One of the hypothesis is that the city government has a KPI for tracking down drugs, so one of the targets became pride adjacent parties. Another hypothesis is around public disruption. Most of the older generation are still very socially conservative, and having pride adjacent public displays is too disruptive. Basically, they are trying to be anti-woke to maintain the current societal structure with as little ripples as possible by sacrificing pride freedom. So why not build that app? It might be that if you did build it, there is a possibility that you will be asked to take it down once it’s published.What we never got to was the business case for this, because whatever you put your effort into doing, you should at least make sure it can sustainably continue running.At the end of this conversation, that’s when it clicked as to what a “Stanton Thought” is. With a lot of my friends, these are my most favorite conversations, where we dive into exploring something that might change or make the world into a better place. So some of my friends have associated this type of conversation or this type of a thought as a “Stanton Thought”.I do this all the time. Maybe, I’ll start writing more of these down." }, { "title": "BNB Greenfield and the Evolution of Decentralized Computing Platforms", "url": "/posts/bnb-greenfield-and-the-evolution-of-decentralized-computing-platforms.md/", "categories": "Crypto", "tags": "crypto, BNB_Chain, BNB_Greenfield", "date": "2023-05-04 15:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "With the recent launch of BNB Greenfield, there was an invitation to write about it via the Greenfield Content Writing Contest (unfortunate that the contest seems to have disappeared, with all the websites supporting the contest having gone down and I have been ghosted as to where I stand, but might as well share here!).As decentralized services have always been a big interest of mine, I took the opportunity to practice my writing and do a deep dive into an exploration of the history and evolution of decentralized computing platforms, where it is now, and where they will go in the future.I’ve always been fascinated with the decentralization of web services we use daily. The first decentralized service I followed was Golem (GNT), a project that was first launched in 2016 with the goal of providing a decentralized computing platform that allows users to rent out their unused computer power. Essentially, Golem was providing a decentralized marketplace for computing power where anyone can participate.With the recent launch of BNB Greenfield, we have another entrant into the decentralized computing platform, so it’s worth taking a look at where we started and where we are now.The following is an exploration into the history and evolution of how we got to the decentralized computing platforms of today.The first decentralized computing projectsThe concept of decentralized computing power has been around for a while. Back in 1999, Berkeley SETI Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley started a project called SETI@home, where people at home could install the BOINC software and volunteer their computer’s computing power to help do scientific work around detecting intelligent life outside of Earth.The 3rd of such large-scale volunteer computing projects (the first 2 being Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS) was launched in 1996 and distributed.net in 1997), it tested the viability of volunteer computing with over 5.2 million participants worldwide donating their computing power, aggregating a total of 2 million years of aggregate computing time across its 21 years of operation.The launch of SETI@home was back before cloud computing was widely available. Websites and online services were still hosted in localized data servers and there were no data center services that allowed you to easily spin up an instance like Amazon’s EC2 and Microsoft’s Azure Virtual Machines. The idea of leveraging unused processing power around the globe to supplement the extensive amount of processing needed for scientific research was a genius idea that came out of necessity and would lead the way to large investments in cloud computing, centralizing service offerings so it made sense from a business perspective.The Introduction of On-Demand Cloud ComputingThe most well-known cloud computing service in the world today is Amazon’s Amazon Web Services (AWS). It started in 2006 as a single product, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), and quickly expanded into over 300 services that are used by businesses of all sizes all over the world.AWS started as an internal project to help launch an e-commerce service called Merchant.com to help third-party merchants like Target or Marks &amp;amp; Spencer build online shopping sites on top of Amazon’s e-commerce engine1. Due to poor future planning, the codebase became a jumbled mess, sparking the requirement to untangle the code into a set of well-documented APIs for ease of use.This first step pushed for a more organized and disciplined approach to developing tools around database, computing, and storage, spreading internally to all of the teams in Amazon as having a common set of infrastructure services made it so that everyone could build without having to reinvent the wheel every time. And thus, AWS was born.The market exploded as these computing and infrastructure services were not only extremely useful and cost-effective for Amazon’s internal teams, but for any companies that required database, compute, and/or storage capabilities for their businesses, which was the majority of companies as we enter the late 2000s. With the successful launch of Amazon S3 in 2006, AWS would then launch Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2007, Amazon Relational Database Services (RDS) in 2008, and continue this pattern of launching a new service every year.Today, the market for cloud computing and infrastructure services is valued at USD 484 billion dollars (as of 2022)2 with large, centralized players including Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and a myriad of others all offering similar on-demand cloud computing services.The Decentralized Opportunity in Web3As centralized services continued to develop and innovate, a decentralized software economy was emerging with the start of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin introduced the concept of the blockchain and a decentralized currency, while Ethereum added programmable smart contracts on top of that. With these two concepts, we usher in the start of Web3, where services that previously were only possible, from a business perspective, by being centralized, could now be offered in a decentralized way as well.The big development is the opportunity to now build trustless transactions between mutually-distrusting parties. Using smart contracts, buyers and sellers can transact directly without an intermediary, and a truly trustless cloud storage marketplace is born.As mentioned earlier, the first project to tackle this idea was Golem, quickly followed by SONM. Both projects focused on distributed compute power, similar to the SETI@home project, and both were made possible by the introduction of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain, which is where they both run.At the same time, distributed storage was being developed. The two first projects to take a stab at this was Storj, launched in 2014, and Sia, launched in 2015. Both Storj and Sia provide a marketplace between a network of decentralized storage providers and users who are looking for storage. Instead of leveraging an existing blockchain, both projects opted to create their own blockchain, Storj on the Storj blockchain and Sia on the Sia blockchain.In 2017, Filecoin and Arweave also entered the space. Filecoin provides a similar decentralized service as Storj and Sia, offering a decentralized marketplace. Filecoin, built on top of Ethereum, takes advantage of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), an open-source project building a distributed file system that splits the data and stores it in smaller chunks with a referencable unique fingerprint. Arweave, built on its own stand-alone blockchain, introduces a new idea and is designed as permanent storage as data is written onto the blockchain directly.In 2020, Flux joins the mix with a focus on replicating AWS in a decentralized manner. Instead of just compute power or data storage, Flux offers instances to run your software in the same way that Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud. This service is slightly more holistic than the previously mentioned projects and will attract a different audience.In 2022, we have Züs, introducing the idea of zero-knowledge proofs into the decentralized storage space. Züs’s pitch leans on privacy and encryption, with the entirety of its stand-alone blockchain, previously known as 0Chain protocol, using zero-knowledge proofs, which allows data to be stored and accessed in a way where the owner does not need to share any details about the file itself for complete privacy (note this is not to say that the previous projects are not using encryption).A myriad of projects is introducing their own takes on how to approach decentralized computing services. The opportunity lies in the fact that none of the players in this space have established dominance yet, leaving decentralized storage and decentralized computing platforms as a nascent Web3 space that is bound to grow as the technology continues to develop.Strengths and Weaknesses of Decentralized StorageTaking a brief step back, why should we even consider decentralized storage? What are the benefits of decentralizing over the current centralized services?If we do an initial breakdown, here are some considerations for decentralized storage: Resilience: Decentralized storage is more resilient to censorship and attack, as it is not stored on a single server. Security: Decentralized storage is more secure than centralized storage, as it is not controlled by a single entity. Privacy: Decentralized storage is more private than centralized storage, as users have more control over their data. Cost-effectiveness: Decentralized storage can be more cost-effective than centralized storage, as it can be shared by multiple users. Scalability: Decentralized storage can be scaled more easily than centralized storage, as it can be added to as needed.The strengths are the same as any form of decentralization, where the distribution allows for much better resilience, security, and privacy, especially from global enforcement entities like governments. Decentralization also has the potential for cost-effectiveness, due to the lower overhead, and scalability as it introduces a lot more flexibility by allowing more service providers into the mix without the requirement of establishing formal business structures and large investments.Of course, we shouldn’t discount the weaknesses as well, which include: Complexity: Decentralized storage is more complex to set up and use than centralized storage. Performance: Decentralized storage can be slower than centralized storage, as it is distributed across multiple nodes. Availability: Decentralized storage can be less available than centralized storage, as it is dependent on the availability of multiple nodes.Again, these weaknesses are applicable to all decentralized projects. Running trustless distributed nodes globally requires new software protocols to handle the complexity, which tends to have a hit on performance. As the projects are still growing, there will be limited availability. The great thing is that none of these weaknesses are unsolvable, with each project team already taking steps towards resolving them in their own way.Back to the main question of why should we be looking at decentralized storage services at all. In the long term, the biggest reason might be censorship and data security.Current centralized storage services are established and have a proven track record. Decentralized storage is a newer technology that is designed to be more resistant to censorship and hacking, but will require time to develop its technology and establish itself as a legitimate alternative to centralized services.Enter BNB GreenfieldThe initial goal of this article was to introduce the new player into this space, so let’s explore what kind of new interesting ideas and opportunities BNB Greenfield brings to decentralized storage.BNB Greenfield is a decentralized data storage system and economy built on the BNB Chain. Like the previously mentioned decentralized storage projects, BNB Greenfield also aims to provide a more secure, efficient, and cost-effective way to store data than traditional centralized storage solutions.The most interesting angle that BNB Greenfield is taking advantage of is its ecosystem. BNB Greenfield will use BNB as its token, and although BNB Greenfield will operate on its own blockchain, it is designed to easily cross-chain between itself and the BNB Chain. That means that BNB Greenfield will be one of the go-to decentralized storage options for projects that are already in the BNB Chain ecosystem.BNB Greenfield is also poised to take large advantage of its marketability as it is supported by BNB Chain’s core team and part of Binance’s larger plan to build out the different decentralized pieces that are needed for a thriving decentralized ecosystem.As it currently stands, BNB Greenfield isn’t doing anything particularly unique in comparison to the other decentralized storage projects that are already in the market, but it is filling in an ecosystem void in the BNB Chain and is positioned to greatly take advantage of that synergy as the BNB Chain ecosystem continues to develop with its extensive number of community and educational initiatives.Decentralized Storage and the FutureAlthough there is now healthy competition in the decentralized storage space, competition really isn’t between decentralized storage projects, but between decentralized and centralized offerings.Users of decentralized storage services are typically other decentralized, or Web3, projects. But the real business value becomes apparent if decentralized storage becomes a desired option for traditional businesses. As mentioned previously, the global market for centralized storage services is USD 484 billion dollars. The long-term goal of decentralized storage services is to tap into this market.But there are a lot of obstacles that still need to be overcome. The instability of cryptocurrencies that are used for payment, the additional computational and energy costs to powering this on a blockchain, the I/O speed of accessing data in storage, and redundancy services that guarantees that there will be no data lost3.If these can be resolved, the trend toward decentralization will be inevitable. Decentralization provides individuals with the opportunity to invest in tangible services that they can control.Previously, it wasn’t possible to individually and directly invest in projects unless you knew the founder of the company was able to IPO. Cryptocurrencies are changing that, providing everyone access to securities from the start.Previously, it wasn’t possible to individually and directly provide liquidity into the traditional financial system. Decentralized finance (DeFi) is changing that, providing decentralized services around borrowing and lending, trading, assets exchange, savings and yield products, synthetic assets, etc., that did not need any human intermediary in between.Previously, it wasn’t possible to individually and directly own game assets. Everything would be hosted in the central servers and if the servers ever shut down, you lost everything. Game finance (GameFi), with the help of NFTs, will offer the ability for games to surpass the value of its game ecosystem.Previously, it wasn’t possible to individually and directly provide compute and data storage services. Decentralized computing platforms are changing that, providing individuals with the opportunity to participate in the marketplace.In conclusion, the decentralized storage space is still young and there is still a lot of catching up to do, but the potential for the entire space is huge.As for BNB Greenfield, it is still in testnet, so there’s still a long way to go. In comparison to other decentralized storage projects, it is still not as mature from a product perspective as projects like Sia and Storj have been around for 6-7 years now. What BNB Greenfield brings to the table though is its ecosystem and the enormous support it has. It will be interesting to see how this translates to growth over the next few years.Footnotes https://techcrunch.com/2016/07/02/andy-jassys-brief-history-of-the-genesis-of-aws/ &amp;#8617; https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/cloud-computing-industry &amp;#8617; https://blocksandfiles.com/2022/11/29/web3-storage/ &amp;#8617; " }, { "title": "Green Bonds need Trustworthy and Accessible Data", "url": "/posts/green-bonds-need-trustworthy-and-accessble-data/", "categories": "Sustainability, Real Estate", "tags": "RESET, healthy_buildings, carbon, climate_change", "date": "2022-05-23 15:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Green bonds are going to be a big deal.We are very well on our way towards a world where many people care about environmental sustainability, climate change, and carbon, and it becomes very obvious when traditional money starts moving heavily towards investing in technologies and companies that fit within this new worldview.In real estate, this is coming in the form of green bonds. So what is a green bond? We get this definition for Investopedia: A green bond is a fixed-income instrument designed specifically to support specific climate-related or environmental projects. TheGreens and money to represent a green bond. By Towfiqu BarbhuiyaDefining a Green BondLet’s take a step back so we can fully understand what a green bond is.Firstly, a bond is a contract or promise by a borrower to pay back a lender. It is essentially a fancy word for a loan, but with one difference. Loans are typically from one source, while bonds are loans designed to be sold to the public, thus making them tradable on the open market. We hear about government bonds all the time as a safe investment because no matter how the market changes, the bond will always pay out the same amount of interest, assuming the government, or whomever the bond issuer is, is good for their word.A green bond is a bond that is related to the environment and sustainability in some way. From a company’s perspective, it is a loan that a company would take where the company needs to hit certain environmental metrics, otherwise, there will be penalties. From the investor’s perspective, it is not only an opportunity to make their money do something good, but companies and projects that are focused on the environment and sustainability likely have a longer-term outlook, thus lowering potential risk.Green bond ExamplesI was introduced to green bonds in 2017 when I first heard about Swire Properties well on its way to implementing one1. In 2018, they raised $500 million USD at a coupon rate of 3.5% due in 2028. With a green bond, instead of just borrowing money, there are a bunch of additional requirements included on top of it. Swire specifically used the Green Bond Principles for their green bond, which includes the four key pillars below: Use of Proceeds Process for project evaluation and selection Management of proceeds ReportingThe green bond is very attractive because of its coupon rate, which is extremely low, offset by how some of the investments made might not have an immediate ROI. The incentive to spend this money wisely is due to that failure to implement accordingly can cause hikes in the coupon rate and other penalties.As for green bonds in other industries, I did some Googling (and landed here) as to what other green bonds there are in the market and this is what I found: Tesla issued a $600 million USD bond in 2013 with a coupon rate of 1.5%-2%. This is an example of a private enterprise issuing a generic bond, but because they are an EV company, it’s being called a green bond.2 Governments are offering green bonds to specifically finance projects focused on low carbon transition. This allows them to use the funds for investment towards solar power, transportation, deforestation, etc. There are now Index and Managed funds on the open market that are invested specifically into companies that have some kind of green angle to them. For example3, Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Green Bond Index includes both labeled and unlabeled investment-grade bonds with requirements on the use of proceeds. The S&amp;amp;P Green Bond Index, using a different set of criteria, screens only for bonds that are labeled by the Climate Bonds Initiative.All this is to say that green bonds are still very nascent.A strong deer to emphasize power.A New Factor of Power and IncentiveThere is a very unique factor to green bonds. That new factor is “green” metrics. Have you ever wondered why ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) metrics are so hot right now? In many ways, ESG is a rebranding of CSR (corporate social responsibility), but it makes a lot more sense to start a fund focused on ESG than CSR, therefore, branding goes where the money goes.With the additional factor of “green” metrics, we now have new numbers to play with. These numbers are data points that Investors and funds can leverage to better understand trends and look for new investment opportunities. Because of the additional reporting requirements, investors and funds can now see how and how much money is being used on the ESG front and how it’s impacting their bottom line. This is becoming more relevant as more and more investors are looking at a longer time horizon than before.This new factor is providing power to investors in the form of data and creating an incentive for companies to invest in global sustainability, as well as their own sustainability.The importance of Trustworthy and Accessible DataWe’re getting to a key point now, which is data. The two frameworks or standards most commonly used today for green bonds are: Green Bond Principles Climate Bonds InitiativeBoth of them have reporting requirements that basically end at “you must report” and the reporting metrics are essentially self-defined by the green bond issuer.ESG metrics are similar. There is a myriad of frameworks and standards out there right now (the most well-known are probably GRI, TCFD, and SASB), but they are all designed as holistic and all-encompassing frameworks that end up doing a lot and very little at the same time. They do a lot because they are standardizing a framework that can be used to compare projects against each other. They are at the same time, doing very little because a lot of these metrics are probably not as important as we think, but because the data points they really want are not there yet or easily accessible, this is the best we can do.Because the data is hard to get, we are also limited in how strict the requirements are. Most of the data we get in ESG is self-reported. Recently, the Chinese government caught a bunch of Chinese firms falsifying the data they were reporting4 because there were tax incentives. Trustworthy data is hard to come by when data is so expensive in the first place.Additionally, almost all of it is snapshot data. Of course, for the real estate market, 1 data point per day is likely to be already pretty good, but can you imagine trading on the stock market when there is only 1 data point per day? Or even worst, one data point per year? It goes to show how behind data gathering is in the real estate industry.I mentioned in a previous article that a carbon tax would only work if data was easy to collect and highly accessible. It stands true with ESG metrics as well. If we want ESG metrics to be ubiquitous, we need standards and frameworks that make it very straightforward as to: what data needs to be collected, how it needs to be collected, how it should be verified for trust, and how to make it highly accessible (to the right people).RESET and Green bonds for Real Estate Disclaimer: I am the President of RESET. If you don’t want to read the plug, you can skip this section, but conceptually, it is quite important.RESET is a data standard with the purpose of promoting healthier and more sustainable built environments. Our data standard essentially sets a framework for the above: what, how, how to verify, and how to make it accessible. We also break it down into embodied data and operating data, one pertaining to the construction phase of the building while the other pertains to the operating phase of the building. Someone recently described RESET as a performance and evidenced based standard instead of a feature-based standard. Essentially, RESET is here to help you measure and collect data about your built environment.Green bonds for real estate will need data. In real estate, the most well-known ESG framework right now is GRESB, establishing a benchmark in the industry. RESET wants to be there to help projects collect the nitty gritty data that will be leveraged not only for future reporting, but also for targeted and optimized solutions.RESET includes 5 modules: Materials (for embodied data) Air (continuous monitoring for occupant health) Water (continuous monitoring for water conservation and water quality) Energy (the most direct way to understand operating carbon) Circularity (continuous monitoring for waste management)These 5 modules are able to provide a holistic approach to collecting the real-time performance data of a building. If green bonds require reporting that is trustworthy and accessible, there is no better approach than standardized, third-party verified, continuously monitored, performance data.Flowing, cascading waterfalls to highlight our conclusion. By Mike LewisA Cascading WaterfallIn real estate, green bonds and ESG investors and funds are being driven by Europe, especially Northern Europe, and they have had a cascading effect on the entire industry. More companies are asking for ESG data than ever before, which then opens the opportunity for more green bonds. As this cycle of money and data continues to roll, we will see a growing ESG and green bond market. Climate change is not going to solve itself, so having this flywheel in place is going to be really beneficial over the next couple of decades for humanity.About RESETRESET is a set of standards and assessment tools &amp;amp; services to develop actionable, long term strategies towards health and sustainability for the built environment.Learn more about RESET.Footnote Swire Properties Green Finance: https://www.swireproperties.com/en/sustainable-development/performance-economic/green-bond.aspx &amp;#8617; Tesla “Green’ bond: https://www.climatebonds.net/2014/05/tesla-issues-600m-5yr-ev-convertible-bond-reminder-join-our-green-sukuk-webinar-thurs &amp;#8617; Text taken from https://greenportfolio.com/blog/understanding-green-bond-funds/ &amp;#8617; China slams firms for falsifying carbon data: https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/14/china-slams-firms-for-falsifying-carbon-data.html &amp;#8617; " }, { "title": "We are all Victims.

Sometimes, it’s just a small bump in the road. Other times, it is a catastrophic avalanche. The result is that you are hurt in some way. You are a victim.You are a victim of some event outside of your control. There was nothing you could have done about it. It is all their fault, who they may be. It is now my fault. There was nothing I could do about it. I was the victim. So what now?It’s now 40 days into the Shanghai lockdown for me. This experience has been terrible for many people. For some, the lockdown has created inordinate amounts of financial stress due to not being able to work or not being able to run their business. For some, this has been catastrophic to their physical health due to lack of hospital resources or potentially due to lack of food. For everyone else, there is some level of stress related to mental health.In a situation where you have no control over it where we are all victims, what should we do? Disclaimer: I am not dismissing the trauma or hardships being experienced. As someone who is very passionate about education and personal development, I am just highlighting thoughts around how to escape from being stuck in a state of victim hood.Result = Event x ReactionOne of the earliest concepts shared with me is: RESULT = EVENT x REACTIONThe RESULT of any situation consists of an EVENT that occurs and then your REACTION to that event. The EVENT is defined as some external situation that is not within your control. REACTION is defined as your reaction to said event. The resulting combination of the EVENT and REACTION will be the final RESULT.What this equation is trying to say is that there are certain things that we can control and certain things that we cannot control. A victim mentality is focusing on the EVENT. Here’s a definition of victim mentality from WebMD: People who have a victim mentality have often suffered through trauma or hard times, but haven’t developed a healthier way to cope. As a result, they develop a negative view of life, where they feel that they don’t have any control over what happens to them.Focusing on EVENT creates a negative cycle of never having any kind of control. This feeling will perpetuate itself and grow until there’s a feeling of inevitability. But instead, if we can focus on on the REACTION, then you will find yourself always in the position of control because the REACTION is always controllable. No matter how traumatic or hard an EVENT might be, if you can develop the mental muscles to roll with the punches, then it will be possible to be strong in the face of adversity.Stoicism tends to focus a lot on this concept and a really powerful quote from Seneca goes as follows: “Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I feared?’” - SenecaFocusing on the SelfTo focus on the REACTION, you need to focus on the self. This involves taking care of your health. In other words, focusing on your self is literally about taking care of yourself. One health framework to use is from an article that James Altucher wrote awhile back called The Daily Practice. The breakdown is that you need to take care of 4 parts of your health: Physical Emotional Mental SpiritualPhysical health is your body. Exercise, sleep, what you eat, etc. We have all heard that your body is your temple and its true. Your emotional, mental, and spiritual health are deeply tied to your physical health.Emotional is about taking care of your feelings and energy. This is the closest thing to mental health. Make sure to increase the positive energy around you by surrounding yourself with it and minimizing negative energy around you by removing it from your lifestyle. This could be in the form of people or news and information.Mental involves your mental muscles and your ability to think. Strong mental health means that you have the ability to think hard and be creative. Training this muscle will allow you to strengthen your ability to choose your REACTION much more.Spiritual is about finding peace. Note that peace is not necessarily happiness, but content-ness. One of the easiest ways is to express gratitude. Focusing on the positives will build a tendency to direct your attention to positives more so than negatives. Meditation, prayer, etc. are all practices that help with developing your spiritual health.If you can build up your heath for all 4, you will develop strong habits to allow you to focus on the REACTION rather than being trapped in the EVENT.Opportunity and SnowballsThe critical key is that this needs to be done by you. Others can help you get started, but the decision must stem from you. Otherwise, it won’t have a chance of sticking.With the world constantly in volatility, there will be more opportunities to fall into a victim mentality. An unfortunate trend that I am seeing is that the ubiquity of content around mental health is being used as a crux to fall into victim mentality. Mental health vocabulary should be used to help you climb out of victim mentality, not lock yourself in there.For people in the Shanghai lockdown or anybody facing hardships, this is an EVENT. If you can take your REACTION and find a way to treat this as an opportunity, you will be able to make something positive come out of this.And once you can help yourself, you will find that this will snowball into something bigger because others are much more willing to help someone who can help themselves.TL;DR. To avoid the victim mentality, you need to be able to take care of yourself." }, { "title": "Synthetic Assets are not Securities", "url": "/posts/synthetic_assets_are_not_securities/", "categories": "Crypto", "tags": "crypto, synthetic_assets, defi_derivatives, horizon_protocol", "date": "2022-05-08 09:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Governments institutions, especially the SEC, have been trying to figure out how to regulate cryptocurrency. I do not envy their position, as cryptocurrency is evolving at breakneck speeds and new concepts and investment strategies are created every month.One of the highlights have been the SEC subpoena against Mirror Protocol, a DeFi synthetic assets platform that offers mirrored assets, or synthetic assets that mirror the price movement of a traditional asset such as stocks or equities. But what are synthetic assets and why does the SEC care?Synthetic assets. From Horizon ProtocolSynthetic Assets vs. SecuritiesSynthetic assets are tokenized derivatives, financial derivatives leveraging crypto blockchains, which are contracts that represent the underlying value of an asset, without requiring actually holding the asset itself.Synthetic assets can be derivatives of stocks, tokens, indices, NFTs, or other financial products and a common subset of synthetic assets, mirrored assets, are produced to mimic the original asset in the form of its price movement. For example, a mirrored asset of a stock would mimic the price fluctuations of the stock, while a mirrored asset of a crypto token would mimic the price fluctuations of said token.A security, on the other hand, is described as the following in Investopedia: The term “security” refers to a fungible, negotiable financial instrument that holds some type of monetary value. It represents an ownership position in a publicly-traded corporation via stock; a creditor relationship with a governmental body or a corporation represented by owning that entity’s bond; or rights to ownership as represented by an option.More specifically, the definition of a security was established by the Supreme Court in a 1946 case, where the definition of a security is based on four criteria: the existence of an investment contract, the formation of a common enterprise, a promise of profits by the issuer, and use of a third party to promote the offering.From the definitions, we can actually quite easily determine that there synthetic assets are not securities. Although multiple crypto tokens might fall into this definition, synthetic assets do not because they are neither a part of the formation of a common enterprise nor are they a promise of profit by the issuer. They are not part of the formation of a common enterprise because owning synthetic assets does not mean that you own shares in the company. You only own something that mimics that price movement of the original asset, or shares in this case. Additionally, because synthetic assets are not issued by the common enterprise, there is no promise of profits.Though synthetic assets most likely will include an investment contract in the form of a smart contract and use third party DeFi platforms to promote the offering, it only fulfills two out of the four criteria required to be defined as a security.Why does the SEC care?Synthetic assets are becoming a big market. In an article from December 2021 on CoinDesk, the second biggest synthetic assets DeFi platform, Mirror Protocol, had synthetic assets worth up to $437 million USD, and this is only one project.It is likely that the SEC is worried about the potential effects and impact of synthetic assets and DeFi derivatives on the traditional finance system and what it means to have other options of investing into the price movement of traditional assets.Synthetic assets and DeFi derivatives are nascent technologies that are still being tested. There are multiple projects dabbling in bringing different aspects of traditional derivatives on-chain into DeFi and you can find some of them here.As the Educational Director of a smaller synthetic assets and DeFi derivatives project, Horizon Protocol, I have been spending a lot of time learning more about DeFi and the potential disruption it can bring. I can very strongly state that I am overwhelmed by the possibilities and very excited for what the future holds.About Horizon ProtocolHorizon Protocol is a decentralized finance project on the BNB Chain with the mission of creating a borderless financial market for synthetic assets.Horizon Protocol is a DeFi platform that facilitates the on-chain trading of synthetic assets that represent the real economy. Horizon Protocol seeks to provide exposure to real-world assets risk/return profiles via smart contracts on the blockchain.Learn more about Horizon Protocol." }, { "title": "SEC’s Proposed rule around Climate Disclosure for Real Estate Companies", "url": "/posts/climate_disclosure_for_real_estate/", "categories": "Sustainability, Real Estate", "tags": "RESET, healthy_buildings, carbon, climate_change", "date": "2022-05-07 09:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "ULI’s magazine, Urban Land, recently published an article regarding the SEC’s proposed rule around climate disclosure for Real Estate Companies.The New RulesThe new rules essentially requires the disclosure of greenhouse gas emissions under the GHG Protocol, including all 3 scopes: Scope 1 emissions - direct emissions from owned or controlled sources Scope 2 emissions - indirect emissions from generation of purchased electricity Scope 3 emissions - all other indirect emissions in company’s value chain, both upstream and downstreamGreen House Gas Protocol - 3 ScopesJust to help provide a bit more context, here’s an example of what Scope 1, 2, and 3 means for a building: Scope 1 emissions - emissions from fuels that are burned on premise or by vehicles owned by the property, including natural gas. Scope 2 emissions - emissions via purchased electricity or other services from the grid, including chilled or hot water (but not the water itself) Scope 3 emissions - any upstream or downstream activities that you can attribute to the business, including employee commuting and travel, embodied carbon from materials and assets, water and waste generated, etc.With these rules set to potentially begin in 2024, there isn’t much time for US based real estate to think about establishing systems to easily collect this data.GHG Scopes and RESETFor most real estate, Scope 1 and Scope 2 data is already available and is relatively easy to calculate by just keeping track of natural gas and energy bills. To take it one step further, it would be to start making this process automatic and collecting the data onto some kind of software that will make the data more accessible.Data accessibility will make it easier to leverage this data for other use cases, including reporting for other purposes, leveraging the data when considering capital expenditure upgrades, or facility operations optimization.Scope 3 is significantly harder, requiring an initial breakdown of all upstream and downstream activities as a first step. I imagine Scope 3 will be a real headache for a lot of companies since it is not well defined yet and is a basket to just throw everything not included in Scope 1 and Scope 2 into.There are some unique parts of Scope 3 that we are trying to tackle though, namely embodied carbon, both upstream and downstream, via RESET Materials, water consumption monitoring via RESET Water, and waste tracking via RESET Circularity. Scope 3 also touches on tenant emissions, which can be facilitated with RESET Energy and can be built into a tenant engagement piece, leveraging the sharing of data as a starting point of engagement.All of this aligns with RESET’s purpose of helping built environments become heather and more sustainable by promoting data collection and continuous monitoring via standardization. We strongly believe that we cannot effectively solve what we cannot measure and that data will be the key to building awareness and visibility towards the problems that we face and it will help us better engage with finding the right solutions to our problems.My gripes with the GHG ScopesThe GHG Protocol and the Scopes are great because they have created a framework for the carbon conversation that we are having today. My main gripes with it is the complexity that it introduces.I was asked a few months ago on whether or not a carbon tax would work. My answer was that there first needs to be a transparent, clear cut, and easy way to collect that data. If it wasn’t easy for all parties involved to collect and get access to the data, the tax would not work because it wouldn’t be easily auditable and there would be no trust in the system.The GHG Protocol currently requires too many middle parties and there are too many different interpretations on exactly how to collect and measure the data. I look forward to when we are able the process is more defined and straightforward.If I could re-design the approach, it would be to first establish the different relevant categories where emissions can come from. Then, make sure that there is an easy and straight forward way to collect data for this category. If the categories are established with clear rules for how data is collected, then companies will only need to compile data for the categories that are relevant to them. Because each category is a stand alone module, this will allow for yearly updates where individual categories get minor upgrades or new categories get updated when new industries or businesses are created.In any case, the trajectory of the industry and the world, in regards to climate change and carbon, has been very positive and promising and I am very excited for where we go next.About RESETRESET is a set of standards and assessment tools &amp;amp; services to develop actionable, long term strategies towards health and sustainability for the built environment.Learn more about RESET." }, { "title": "Shanghai&#39;s Lockdown and Food - A Microcosm to explore the Global Supply Chain", "url": "/posts/shanghais-lockdown/", "categories": "Random Ideas", "tags": "shanghai, lockdown", "date": "2022-05-06 09:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "It is a little over one month into the Shanghai lockdown, which started on April 1st for the majority of people on the west side of the city and started on March 25th for people on the east side of the city. There still hasn’t been any definitive answer as to when this will end other than the policy this lockdown is trying to fulfill: zero COVID, where there is no COVID actively spreading in the population.For this piece, we will be focusing on the logistics of food in a city that is frozen still and we will not be diving into details around mass testing, lack of hospital access, business and economic repercussions from being closed for so long, and a myriad of other mishaps and unpleasantries due to the situation.Empty streets of Shanghai, by Gao Zheng. More photos available here.The Start of the LockdownLet’s first set up the situation. In early March, the Huating Hotel was one of the sites for mandatory quarantine for people flying back into mainland China. Due to an outdated indoor air system that allowed COVID-19 to spread throughout the hotel, employees of the hotel started carrying the virus back to their communities all across Shanghai. This is the first real occurrence of the Omicron variant spreading uncontrolled in China, and the government was not prepared on how to handle it.Initially, sporadic lockdowns were happening in communities around Shanghai, with mass testing to pin down where the virus has spread. The Shanghai government kept stating that there is no way that they will lock down the entire city at once and will take a localized approach where small sections of the city are locked down at a time to minimize disruption to the local economy.Unfortunately, things took a turn for the worst when it became apparent that the virus spread was completely out of control as the mass testing broke all previous models that China had encountered. Omicron was a different beast in terms of transmission vitality, and the previous methods were not working anymore.It was dictated from the top that the city of Shanghai would go into a full lockdown with assurances that it would only last five days. The five days would come and go without any clear indication of when it might end.The Early DaysAs the city shut down, everything stopped. The streets were empty, with not a car nor a pedestrian in sight. All shops and malls were closed. Everyone was locked down in their residences, or for some, in their offices. The first five days weren’t so bad as most homes had enough food to last. But when the lockdown did not lift after five days, the logistics of food would get stretched to a breaking point.The issue is that there was nobody to deliver anything. There was an abundance of food outside of the city. Still, due to the lockdown, all the delivery workers were stuck at home, and there was nobody to deliver anything to the approximately 6 million households in Shanghai.All the previous methods of acquiring food failed. All restaurants were closed, so there would be no prepared food that could be bought. All the typical online platforms for shopping like Taobao and JD.com had things for sale but no ability to deliver.Therefore, the only thing available was for the government to establish a centralized service to deliver care packages of food to each of the 6 million households. Boxes of food were loaded up into trucks and delivered to residential compounds and distributed by the Community Committees, which were representatives of each community that were in touch with the government.Many residential compounds were able to receive these care packages, but as with any large-scale change and implementation, there were bound to be outliers. Stories abound with mishandled food, food wastage due to the food going bad, failed logistics where the food wasn’t delivered to the right place, etc. were shared.During these early days, we had a situation where there was an external abundance of food, but a lack of logistics and delivery services to get the abundance to where it needed to go. As a global economy, we have become very centralized in regards to production for the optimization and efficiency gains, but this centralization puts pressure on logistics and delivery services. If there are capacity issues in logistics and delivery, either from lowered supply or increased demand, there will be bottlenecks that will disrupt the entire supply chain. The reality is that we live in a very connected world and the global supply chain is all connected.Group BuyingAs we entered mid-April, some delivery services were starting to become available, but since it was still a very scarce resource, the services would only be available for large quantity deliveries. This began what is best described as Group Buying.Residential Compounds were using WeChat to organize Group Buys, where someone would state that they were interested in buying something, invite the entire compound to join them, record the size of the order, collect the money, and organize the distribution once the delivery arrives.For some, these Group Buys allowed them to get access to luxuries, such as bread, milk, seafood, etc., anything that wasn’t part of the government care packages. For some others, Group Buys were a lifeline because either their care packages were not delivered properly or their household had more people than others. The government care packages did not consider the number of people in each household.The one sliver of a silver lining to the Shanghai Lockdown is that there has been a lot of community building via these Group Buys. Most households have joined their local residential compound WeChat groups. People are talking and helping each other out, especially to take care of the older generation who are not familiar with all the technology.Group buying is an example of shifting responsibilities in logistics to release pressure on the bottlenecks. In this case, since there was very little resource around delivery in and around the city, it required local communities to group together for larger orders to incentivize priority for their requests. In the global supply chain, there have also been attempts to release pressure on bottlenecks at the shipping ports by shifting towards air shipping and smaller shipping ports that cannot handle the larger container ships. But progress has been slow because there is no real alternative for sea shipping, and the infrastructure required for more shipping ports is expensive and time-consuming. And if that is the case, there might need to be an exploration into other ways to decrease the pressure on the bottleneck, including increasing local production that can bypass the bottleneck.Where we are nowAs of May 7th, Shanghai is still under lockdown with no clear end date. Although the food situation is relatively under control, there are plenty of other issues that need solving. The logistics of food during the Shanghai Lockdown and how it was solved in the short term is interesting because it can easily be extrapolated into the larger global supply chain, including the issues the global supply chain is encountering and possible solutions that can be explored.Because everything is so connected, it should also bring into mind that we are now in a world where massive disruptions will become the new normal, whether through pandemics, climate change, financial collapses, war, etc. There needs to be a consideration for the right balance between centralization and decentralization of production and logistics to generate as much stability as possible. 2022-05-18 Update: Added a couple photos of food below.By May, logistics was getting better, but most people are still locked in. My lockdown has been extended by at least 10 days because someone in my residential compound was found to be positive.A box of food from the government.

The topic was “Political Correctness + Cancel Culture”. The intention was to connect technology with political correctness, which has created cancel culture, but most of the time was spent defining and exploring political correctness as a concept and as a term.What I’ll be writing is based on the notes from the conversations that we had, so the content and logic might jump around a little. Note that this does not directly reflect my opinion, but there are interesting ideas in here that might provide valuable content to help Make Everyone Think Harder.1. What is Political Correctness? What is Cancel Culture?We started the session exploring what Political Correctness (often referred to as PC) and Cancel Culture is. The reason I chose to put these two together is because I think they are very relevant with each other, with cancel culture being a recent manifestation of political correctness thanks to the conveniences of technology access and social media.Let’s start with a dictionary definition. According to Oxford, political correctness is “the avoidance, often considered as taken to extremes, of forms of expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against.”Some connotations of the term, political correctness, that were shared is that it is most applicable to smaller groups or minorities and that it is often used to define and express what is and what is not acceptable in terms of social norms.As for Cancel Culture, it is a much newer term for online shaming and according to Wikipedia, it can be defined as “the practice of withdrawing support for (or canceling) public figures and companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive”. Essentially, it is a collective expression of the masses to showcase that they are unhappy or in disagreement with someone else’s opinion.2. Why is Political Correctness and Cancel Culture a thing?So why is political correctness a thing? One reason is for setting boundaries as a form of social self defense. Political correctness allows people to create boundaries around topics that are offensive to them. It allows them to label people as others if they are disagreeing with their point of view and also to unify others who are of the same opinion and view point. And gradually, as it nears critical mass, we are looking at groups of people perhaps forming an identity around certain opinions on subjects.The most popular and obvious example of this is in racism. In North America, the word, nigger, is off limits to everyone except for black people, to the point that if I wanted to be PC, I’m probably supposed to write it as if I’m swearing, like this: n*gger. No specifics on where the black person is from, just that anybody without black skin should not use this word. The word has been made into an identity to differentiate themselves from insiders and outsiders. It is only PC for insiders to use the word. For everyone else, it is offensive. Other examples include gender, industry, body shaming, etc.A question that was brought up is that is this a specific phenomenon in North America or do a lot of minorities that have been subjugated at one point in time in history also do something similar?Another reason for the gradual increase in political correctness is sensitivity. Our society is becoming a society of snowflakes (people who are easily offended) because we have created environments where we do not build resilience. People are challenged less often because upon hitting a wall, there is always a crevice somewhere that will align with your ideals already, so you congregate with these people instead of challenging your ideals. As a society, we are becoming too sensitive because we have created an environment that protects sensitive people and PC is an additional tool that can be used to call someone out for offending you.Which leads us into cancel culture. Cancel Culture became a thing because it is very easy to say things online. Being semi-anonymous without direct and face-to-face repercussions allows people to express a less filtered side of themselves. There just isn’t as much accountability on social platforms.Additionally, cancel culture allows individuals to assert dominance. A lot of people have a lack of power in daily life. They feel stuck and feel like they are effectively neutered with no control over their professional and personal life and there is a lack of confidence to fight against this lack of power. Participating in cancel culture allows them to part of something where minimal effort can have a dominating effect on someone else. It gives them the illusion of power and it is intoxicating. Cancel culture is the culmination of lazy thinking, where people don’t have to think hard and can follow along with the masses (the opposite of what we are doing here with METH), and the ability to maximize an individual’s impact by co-opting the conversation.So, is there a good side and a bad side to being PC?3. What is good PC? What is bad PC?Some of the good things about being PC is that it helps set rules that make a certain group of people feel good, limits their discomfort, and generally makes it easier to maintain social norms by establishing the rules that clarify and remove the potential of embarrassment in public for the purposes of comfort. It cultivates harmony in a society and generally informs people on how to not be a jerk.Some of the bad things about being PC is that it ignore’s different people’s ideas and shuts down dialogue. Cancel culture is an example that uses technology to shut down people who have ideas that differ from ours. This is a big issue from a society’s perspective because it limits intellectual exploration. PC culture also limits creativity and prevents self reflection and discovery because a lot of people are given containers and molds that they need to fit into. There is a huge risk for many people to change ideologies or to explore and embrace other ideas.To take this a step further, most of the global society has a culture around money. PC is now used as a part of a company’s public relations strategy, to make a company align and seem good in the eyes of consumers.From a more philosophical perspective, what is good and what is bad is highly subjective and based on context. Is good and bad defined by god, by society, or by individuals? Or does it just have to be generally accepted by a certain majority? A great question that was asked is whether or not a political correctness culture is political correct in itself or not?An interesting point that was brought up is that cancel culture is an act of implementing political correctness online from an individual perspective in a grassroots approach. It is the opposite of institutional political correctness, where an established power states whether something is politically correct or not. For example, certain government parties stating how it is offensive to attack certain groups of people for supporting their ideology would be an institutional use of political correctness.Another interesting point is the public and private dichotomy. In private conversations, most people are much less PC. They can speak their mind and not worry about the repercussions because it is severely localized to the few people listening to their conversations. But nowadays, the private and public is merging, with many people not understanding the difference when posting on social media. Bringing the private into the public requires significantly more consideration in regards to the language and content that is expressed if someone wants to conform.4. What is the future of political correctness?The general conclusion we came to is that political correctness is a way to establish and use power. The good aspects of PC is representative of a shield while the bad aspects of PC is representative of a sword or a weapon. One is used to defend and the other is use to attack. Therefore, political correctness is not necessarily a culture, but a tool to be used to grab and control power.Our group leaned more towards the negatives of political correctness, on how it is stopping conversations, can make people faker, and it is generally a lazy way for most people to seek consensus without respecting that diversity and complexity is the essence of human society. Additionally, in the future, conversations around Political Correctness will move increasingly from offline to online, extend increasingly beyond national borders, and be increasingly weaponized to motivate political change.Education is going to play a very important part in improving the situation, which is in desperate need of refreshing to accommodate the issues and interactions that we encounter in the 21st century. There needs to be more education around communication and empathy, connecting with different people and cultures, especially those that think differently from you. Most cultures around the world inherently have different acceptance levels and understanding of PC culture. Education includes the mass media, which plays a big role in exacerbating this if they play a role in isolating people into certain identities and limit the ability for people to think harder.Lastly, we believe that the term, “Political Correctness”, is outdated. Most of the correctness nowadays does not relate to politics, but are more about social issues. We should call it “Social Correctness” instead.What is M.E.T.H.?M.E.T.H. (Make Everyone Think Harder) are interactive events where participants learn, brainstorm, and share ideas. Participants need to bring with them their creativity, philosophy, and a good amount of open mindedness.The events are designed to be slightly uncomfortable and touch on potentially sensitive topics with the goal of bringing out opposing view points, thoughts, and ideas.Events are currently being run in Shanghai." }, { "title": "METH Summary 2 - Gender Equality and Feminism", "url": "/posts/meth-2-gender-equality-and-feminism/", "categories": "Education, METH", "tags": "METH, gender_equality, feminism", "date": "2020-08-09 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "The second METH event was in mid July and I had not come around to writing summary until now, nearly 6 weeks later. The topic was “Gender Equality + Feminism” and the goal was to invite a equal number of women and men to participate. I didn’t succeed with a 50/50 ratio, but we did succeed in having at least one male per group.What I’ll be writing is based on the notes from the conversations that we had, so the content and logic might jump around a little. Note that this does not directly reflect my opinion, but there are interesting ideas in here that might provide valuable content to help Make Everyone Think Harder. And note that we did not dive into the topic of intersex, not because we don’t believe it’s a thing, but because we wanted to focus on a part of the conversation first.1. What is gender quality + feminism?Starting off, we invited all the participants to share topics that related to gender equality or feminism. There was a focus on women in work where gender inequality displayed itself, including the payment gap, issues around maternity leave, sexual harassment, and a lack of female leadership in businesses and corporations.In regards to women in families, it was brought up that there are now divorce laws that include cool down periods, which might result in less opportunity to get out of domestic violence. Someone brought up that women had less control over their bodies than men, with conversations around pro-life and surrogates being only relevant to women. Additionally, there is interest in exploring who the family bread winner should be.From a general policy perspective, someone mentioned the blurring of sports between sexes, which takes us into the dynamics between sexes, where we might look into transexuals or others in the LGBTQ spectrum.Lastly, some shared the liberal arts definitions of feminism, including how it started, the 4 Ways of Feminisms, and a quick comparison between chauvinism and feminism.2. Explore gender equality + feminismThe first question I posed for the small groups to discuss is: “Why is gender equality and feminism a thing?”. The goal is to explore gender equality and feminism and leave it open ended enough so that each small group can leverage their background to contribute as much as possible towards the conversation.When it came time to sharing, the main focus was on women in the work force. The first thing to be shared was the gender pay gap and that the main reason for it is not actually due to gender. The gender pay gap is listed to be approximately 9%. The bulk of that 9% is caused by factors such as age, location, interests, etc., while the actual gender only makes up 5% of the 9% wage gap. I’m not going to dig in to the statistics of this, but there is merit in looking at all the factors that can affect this because there are wage gaps in everything. A counter example might be the male nurse vs the female nurse, where the male nurse makes less. Is there a hidden cost to being a male nurse? Is it due to supply and demand?To continue, we also explored how there are more females in entry + mid level jobs while men took the majority of the top level jobs. Why is that? Is the selection process really a meritocracy? Probably not, as each person hiring will have their own bias. Is it a difference and male and female personalities? For example, that women on average are more weak willed and cannot cut it in tough environments? Statistically speaking, this might play into part of it in the sense that on average, women tend to be more collaborative and emotionally conscious to the people around them while men are more stubborn, obstinate, and single-minded towards their pursuit of their goal. This obviously does not apply to all women or all men, but is a general stereotype. Another factor is the idea of passing done legacies via the males in the family, so a lot of family businesses might lean more towards passing the torch over to the son instead of the daughter. Changing this will require changing the status quo. And lastly, where you were born. There are certain cultures that treat men and women differently, mainly lifting up men to positions of power while putting down women into positions of servitude.The reasons for gender equality has to partly do with economics. The free market for the employees and the employer creates opportunities for discrimination, which led to a discussion on what kind of a free market should we be striving for. It is interesting to note that even countries like the US did not always operate with a free market.At the end of the day, the changes needed will require government support in the form of policies. Policies that can help find more balance between men and women, for example, requiring both paternity and maternity leave instead of just maternity leave. The goal should be to provide more equality in opportunities, not necessarily strive for equal results.3. What is the value for feminism + gender equality for men?To explore this further, we wanted to see how men would benefit from more gender equality and the feminist movement. This is important because the ally that feminism needs is men.The first thing we agreed on is that extremism in any way is bad and that we need to find nuance. We should look at changing gender role stigmas not only in the workplace, but at home as well. Society currently puts the family breadwinner pressure on men (in China, men are expected to have a car and an apartment before getting married), which can have an impact on male mental health and their masculinity, very critical when you consider that most men do not have an outlet to talk about these kinds of issues. Suicide rates are already higher for men due to the pressure.There are numerous benefits from gender equality for men. In the work place, more women in leadership means more opinions targeting the female audience, which can in turn generate more value and money for the company. In relationships and family, gender equality can equate to a better marriage because there is less pressure on men to be the sole breadwinner and allow for the possibilities of house dad’s (which every male has fantasized being at some point in their life). Lastly, gender equality will mean more sex for men because women will be less slut shamed, meaning both genders can be more open about their desire for sex.4. What should be equal? What shouldn’t be equal? And what should we do? What are some solutions?To finish up the M.E.T.H. session, we explored the approach to equality and potential solutions.We all agreed that gender equality was important for society because the structure allows for better allocation of resources and increases access and opportunities to a larger part of the population. This justifies the feminism movement because it brings to light the problem of gender equality and moves us towards a future where society is better.There are certain realities that cannot be changed. Hormonal levels are different, general physicality is different, and both sexes have their own benefits in society.Therefore, solutions involve creating opportunity rather than achieving equal results. For example, due to physicality, it doesn’t make sense to require equal number of males and females in the military, but there should be opportunities for women who can hit the same thresholds to be part of the team. In the workforce, gender job issues can be solved by being more transparent about the necessary skills of the job and allow both males and females the same number of baby days off. There should be more policies around preventing domestic violence and better laws to help catch perpetrators.We can already see the gradual change with more people speaking out and making everyone more aware.

The session went really well and I would like to share what happened and what was shared.What I’ll be writing is all based on the notes from the conversation we had, so things might jump around a little. This also does not directly reflect the opinion I have, but provided valuable content to help Make Everyone Think Harder.1. What is happening?In the U.S., George Floyd was recently killed by a policeman. The policeman knelt on his neck while Floyd had his hands tied for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. Floyd ended up suffocating to death.This sparked protests and riots all across the U.S. There was looting and arson and significant destruction to property. The riots were happening to protest against police killings and police brutality, especially against the black community. Did I mention that George Floyd is black?As the protests went on, things started to spiral out of control. Part of the reason was because the COVID-19 pandemic had kept people indoors for way too long, so the protests was a great reason for people to get out. People and companies started choosing sides and if you chose anything other than Black Lives Matter, you would be called out or fired from your job, like the NYT’s chief editor for writing a conservative piece or the UCLA professor who opposed leniency to black students. Escalation continued with an autonomous zone being created in Seattle and Trump threatening that “If the looting starts, the killing starts.But some good things were happening. There is discussion for police department reforms and even discussions around the terms “whitelist” and “blacklist” to be changed to “inclusion list” and non-inclusion list”.2. Why is this happening?Why are the protests so explosive? Why has the entire country come out for this?Social media is a big factor. It is extremely easy to share ideas today and seeing George Floyd being killed while he was not resisting was highly emotional. It was the straw that broke the camel’s back.The stress of COVID-19 also contributed to this. Mental health was at an all time low and people’s wallets were also taking a large hit due to COVID’s effect on the economy. The combination of lowered mental health and the highly emotional footage of Floyd’s death created fireworks. The fire was further fueled by Trump’s messaging and the legacy and history in regards to slavery.There was one practical point that needed to be addressed, but wasn’t. Due to the structure and the system created over time to protect policeman in general, it had created a situation where policemen were immune to their wrong doings, which in turn, created a big problem: systemic racism. The system had already evolved into something where if nobody in the system was individually racist, the system would make it so that they would perform tasks that could be racist.3. What do they want? And what are some potential solutions?The unifying banner for the protests was Black Lives Matter. This is because the police brutality towards black people had gotten so bad that black lives were being extinguished by the police in far higher numbers than any other groups of people for reasons that were not always clear.The protestors wanted to seek for equality. That black people and white people could be treated equally. The first part of this is police reform. There should be more police accountability and there should be less police immunity. The second part is economic equality via healthcare, education, housing, job opportunities, etc, because the real culprit of everything that is happening is systematic economic inequality.There is an interesting dynamic as the middle class disappears. When people are disenfranchised, they will lash out. In this case, there are a lot of white people that have lost their middle class status and are taking it out on others. Racism has increased in part due to the economic woes of others.To fix these issues, there needs to be systematic change. People need to be empowered, and one way to do that is to get them to vote locally. To get them to vote, voting needs to be easier and local organizations need to educate their base.Education is obviously going to be a big part of this, but that is much longer term. Everybody needs to play a part, especially the media, who are currently making matters worse by dividing and targeting certain audiences and creating echo chambers.Lastly, there needs to be a strong drive in the direction of economic equality. Not actual economic equality, but something in that direction to help the disenfranchised get back on their feet and to re-build the middle class so that the poverty class does not get pushed to the extreme. Otherwise, the protests that we have seen so far would be nothing compared to what will happen.What is M.E.T.H.?M.E.T.H.

In his op-ed on the Washington Post, “We Asian Americans are not the virus, but we can be part of the cure”, he writes that “For the first time in years, I felt it. I felt self-conscious – even a bit ashamed – of being Asian,”, and that Asian Americans “need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need”. Basically, it puts the onus on Asian-Americans to take action and, to a certain extent, removes the blame on racists.Immediately, there was backlash. He got attacked by Asian Americans for not understanding what it’s like to be Asian American and how he doesn’t understand racism and the like.But I agree with him.I agree with him because I am living in reality. To get someone to change their mind, you don’t do it by defending your point of view, but by understanding their point of view and working from there. There is no logical way to argue about racism. You can only do it through empathy, and it’s not through your empathy. It’s through their empathy. That means it is not you that needs to empathize with the racists. It is getting the racists to empathize with you.And don’t expect to be successful. The further reality is that changing someone’s mind is extremely hard, especially someone who doesn’t want to be changed. The best time to build empathy is during times of their crisis. Help them when they are at their lowest. That is when they will feel the most empathy.Andrew Yang’s proposal to show that we are also Americans is doing exactly that. We are in a crisis. So find ways to help racists empathize. Strike at them on what they care about, being American. Help them connect.Yes, blaming others and pointing fingers is cathartic. It also doesn’t change anything. It’s the equivalent of praying for gun violence to stop. It is idealistic and ineffective. Very few people change their mind when they are attacked on their ideology or their truth.And this is true for all -isms. Sexism, racism, and all other prejudices are the status quo. To change the status quo, we need to be better than them. We need to be the ones to make the effort, because there is no way that they will voluntarily make the effort for you. If you have grievances, take action. Make the change happen. Fight. Endure. Connect. And start the movement. But remember, the movement is to allow the other side to empathize with you, not to attack them.In all land wars, the only way to win is to win the hearts of the conquered. To win hearts, you need them to empathize with you. Fighting against racism is a war.What do you think?" }, { "title": "Intro to METH - Make Everyone Think Harder", "url": "/posts/intro-to-METH-make-everyone-thing-harder/", "categories": "Education, METH", "tags": "ideas, METH", "date": "2020-04-30 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "After becoming an adult and entering the real world, conversations are typically centered around money, business, love, or pop culture (i.e. Tiger King). I miss the intellectual conversations I used to have in college for intellectual sake. Random conversations about philosophy, futurism, weird questions about life, etc. So I have decided that I want to meet more people who feel the same way.Inspired by Andrew Yang’s MATH slogan, which stands for Make American Think Harder, I have decided to start METH - Make Everyone Think Harder (if you are laughing or making a WTF face, then I’ve done my job). This is a pet project of mine and I’ve been planning it for a few months now.METH is a series of interactive events where participants will learn, brainstorm, and share ideas, based on the selected topic for the event. The idea is to create an environment that brings people together to have an intellectual conversation, focusing on creativity, philosophy, and a good amount of open mindedness.One of the event topic series that I have come up with is the Future Series, which includes the following: Future of Education Future of Sustainability Future of Spaces Future of Health Future of Finance and Money Future of SocietyOther series includes the Life Series, focused around life skills, and the Sunzi series, focused on the Art of War and its application in real life.What I hope to achieve with METH is intellectual stimulation in a population whose head is always down and running in the rat race. Because most people don’t have the time or mental capacity to seek mental stimulation, I hope to make it more easily accessible.This is important because we live in a very interconnected society. Our society, especially those that are democracies, need people who can think. Properly. If not, we have people who are delusional and uninformed, without the capability of ever righting themselves.With METH, there are a few skills I hope people who attend will develop. Most importantly, the ability to have high level conversations while keeping an open mind, especially when disagreeing. I want an environment that fosters proper debate where the goal is not to argue or to be right, but to learn and understand each other. The other skills are based on the series. The future series should help attendees develop a sense of longer term thinking, including futurist thinking and long term goal planning. The life series focuses on developing life skills that aren’t taught in school, including empathy, money, and inner confidence. The Sunzi, or Art of War, series will features strategic and tactical thinking in life.METH is one of my attempt at improving our society, using an event model with rules to create an environment to spark mental stimulation. I hope the stimulation will make everyone think harder. What do you think? Would you be interested in participating in METH events?" }, { "title": "Police State Surveillance designed for the People", "url": "/posts/police-state-surveillance-designed-for-the-people/", "categories": "Random Ideas", "tags": "ideas, covid-19, police_state, surveillance, lockdown", "date": "2020-04-29 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "Here’s another COVID-19 topic. This one, in particular, focuses on the differences between how China and the rest of the world has handled the pandemic, focusing on one thing in particular: people tracking.Soon after the pandemic became official and China went into lockdown, they started preparing the Health Code software, which tells you whether or not you might have been near someone who was confirmed to have the coronavirus. If you haven’t, your Health Code will be green. If you might have, it will be yellow, and if you definitely have, it will be red. For a period of time, everywhere you went (entering buildings, public transportation, etc.), you were required to pull out the Health Code and show that you were green.The way they track you is through the telecom companies. Essentially, all phones that are connected are being triangulated all the time to get an idea of where you’ve been. And this is possible because China can do police state things and nobody can do anything about it. I mean, just look at all the cameras on the streets of Shanghai. The cameras can automatically ticket cars for traffic and parking violations. The cameras can also automatically ticket jay walkers if they try to cross on a red.The biggest benefit to all this is that China can implement these tracking systems whenever they want. Additionally, cities feel very safe for the occupants because there is evidence for anything that happens in public. The Chinese police are very good at tracking you down if they want to (they normally don’t care because there are way too many problems going on at any one time and they are limited in man power). The potential downside is the abuse of the power and potential privacy concerns.So let’s address these two downsides and come up with potential solutions. In regards to the abuse of power, there needs to be a transparent way to see how the data gets used. This can be in the form of documentation on the systems that will be using the data and a list of entities that access to the data for other purposes with reasoning on when and why they would need to access the data. There should be a public log on who has access the data with reasoning. There should be no entity that can get access to the data beyond the official cases without a log entry being recorded somewhere. The goal of this log is to have a way for the public to police the police and hold them accountable. The public log will be key to that.The second concern is privacy. To which I ask, what type of privacy is important? I believe having the privacy of your own space and being able to be yourself is important for mental health. But is it important that you have privacy in public places? Is it important to have privacy in terms of where you’ve been? I mean, the only people that will be hurt by this are ones who are lying about where they are (cough adulterers cough). So what is the balance for privacy? I think it is nuanced and we should not look at privacy as one large interconnected chunk of rock, but as a small mountain of pebbles that we need to sort through.By having abuse of power and privacy sorted, is police state surveillance still scary? What do you think?" }, { "title": "COVID-19 says that Automation + UBI is the Future", "url": "/posts/covid-19-says-automation-and-ubi-is-the-future/", "categories": "Random Ideas", "tags": "ideas, covid-19, automation, UBI, future", "date": "2020-04-28 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "With COVID-19, one of the biggest affect on our lives is that our entire global economy is all interconnected and powered by labor. When labor stops, either because we need to have social distancing or factories get shutdown due to everyone under quarantine, everything comes to a halt.What is the solution to this issue? Obviously, it’s automation. COVID-19 is a demonstration of a pandemic, one that we have seen from mobile games like Plague and movies like Contagion (2011). The key to solving the pandemic is isolation. Keep people away from other people so they can transmit.And automation solves everything. We need automated factories. We need automated transportation and logistics. We need automated laborers in the form of Boston Dynamic’s Atlas. Actually, we wouldn’t even need most of these robots to have AI. We only need high quality internet and connectivity, like 5G, to be able to control these robots. The only jobs that we need humans to do will be possible within the comfort of their homes. That is, assuming that they have one.Which comes to the second part of the equation. What if you don’t have a comfortable home? Where do you isolate yourself? And what if automation is everywhere, what happens to all the labor jobs and white collar repetitive jobs?That’s why I love the concept of UBI (Universal Basic Income, google it if you don’t what this is yet). Something like a monthly income that will guarantee that you can get a roof over your head and food in your belly somewhere within the country. That means this money is not for you to live in New York City. This guarantees people the time to figure things out and stand back up, either through educating themselves and investing in something that will allow them to do some kind of work to make extra money. It allows people, regardless of their situation, to ride out pandemics.And to get the money, tax the automation in the form of a wealth tax. Not. Robots are not persons (yet) and so a wealth tax would do nothing since all the money will exist in corporations. A VAT (value added tax) that collects from every transaction made in the country is the obvious way to go. Both UBI and VAT are 3 letter acronyms that really are just such an amazing decomplexification (simplification) of a terribly hard problem. Create one rule that creates a floor for all human beings and create one rule that taxes everything by the amount that is spent.If you think I sound like Andrew Yang, that’s because I’m a big fan and I generally agree with most of what he has said as it aligns so strongly with my personal futurist thinking. I think this is the most humanistic way to approach it. The other way to look at it is natural selection, where people who are poor, old, weak, stupid, unlucky, etc. should just not be able to pass along their genes. I am okay with both of these solutions, but if I had a choice, I would most definitely choose the more humanist approach.What do you think? What does the future look like to you?" }, { "title": "Controlling Fake News while maintaining Freedom of Speech", "url": "/posts/controlling-fake-news-while-maintaining-freedom-of-speech/", "categories": "Random Ideas", "tags": "ideas, freedom_of_speech, fake_news", "date": "2020-04-27 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "The western world has an environment with freedom of speech, where anybody can say whatever they want, about whoever they want. These statements need not be true or free from bias, thus, creates an interesting problem: fake news.Alternatively, we have a country like China that has established control over the news media and free speech in general. They have backdoor access to all widely used private chat apps, have control over the telecoms, all public media, and blocks access to everything they cannot control via the Great Firewall. The benefit of this is that it obviously cuts down on fake news. The negative aspect is that all news is news that the government wants you to see and hear, whether it is true or false. Another aspect is that there is no ability for people to share information that the government deems destructive, which include most forms of grievances against the government. This creates a totalitarian environment where the best thing you can hope for is that the government leadership is benevolent and is largely taking actions that are good for the majority. If they are not, well, then you have North Korea.I believe that freedom of speech is an important concept because the future requires transparency, but at the same time, we need to consider whether or not a population is ready for it. Freedom of speech does not mean the freedom from consequences. I believe freedom of speech, along with democracies, requires a certain level of societal and political education. This can be another topic I explore in the future. For now, let’s get back to fake news.My proposal for dealing with fake news is to have a ranking system for news. The ranking system works like this: Each new piece of news starts off at rank 0. Each piece of news gets verified by a third party organization whose sole job is to verify the veracity of a certain piece of news, similar to Snopes.com These third party organizations are funded by tax dollars. There should be at least 3 of them and they should not be politically aligned. They should be truth seekers. These third party organizations will state whether or not a piece of news should be treated as fact or purely as opinion. All news and media pieces need to display their ranking.Most news pieces will be rank 0 because the third party verification organizations will have limited amounts of time. They will only be able to verify the more important pieces of news. This means that any news with Rank 0 should always be taken with a significant grain of salt.What do you think? How would you control fake news while maintaining the concept of freedom of speech?" }, { "title": "Writing Goal to 365 Ideas", "url": "/posts/writing-goal-to-365-ideas/", "categories": "Random Ideas", "tags": "ideas", "date": "2020-04-18 11:30:00 +0000", "snippet": "Hi, I’m Stanton and I am a futurist who is very interested in topics around the environment, education, healthcare, society, and money.
