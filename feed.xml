In a company where you’re safe from losing your jobs, there will be a part of the population who decides that working hard is not for them, which means that productivity goes down. In China, they have a specific term for government jobs, “体制内”, meaning, “within the system”. Because these job... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How to better penalize delivery driver traffic violations</title><link href="https://stantonwong.com/posts/ST2-how-to-better-penalize-delivery-driver-traffic-violations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to better penalize delivery driver traffic violations" /><published>2025-08-15T15:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2025-08-21T13:23:08+00:00</updated> <id>https://stantonwong.com/posts/ST2-how-to-better-penalize-delivery-driver-traffic-violations/</id> <content src="https://stantonwong.com/posts/ST2-how-to-better-penalize-delivery-driver-traffic-violations/" /> <author> <name>Stanton Wong</name> </author> <category term="Stanton Thoughts" /> <summary> Another “Stanton Thought” conversation popped up this week, this time with a co-worker. As we were walking to lunch, we saw a delivery driver get stopped by a policeman. The policeman was telling the delivery driver to stop so he can issue him a ticket for driving on the sidewalk. The delivery driver was trying his best to get away, alternating between backing up and driving forward around the... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Stanton Thoughts</title><link href="https://stantonwong.com/posts/stanton_thought/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stanton Thoughts" /><published>2025-08-13T15:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2025-08-16T08:11:29+00:00</updated> <id>https://stantonwong.com/posts/stanton_thought/</id> <content src="https://stantonwong.com/posts/stanton_thought/" /> <author> <name>Stanton Wong</name> </author> <category term="Stanton Thoughts" /> <summary> A good friend of mine and I were chatting over beers this week and he suddenly said that he had a “Stanton Thought”. I was confused, because this is never a term that we’ve used together before. He started explaining that there needs to be more education and systems in place to protect against sexually transmitted diseases in China, especially for non-straight people. There is definitely a lac... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>BNB Greenfield and the Evolution of Decentralized Computing Platforms</title><link href="https://stantonwong.com/posts/bnb-greenfield-and-the-evolution-of-decentralized-computing-platforms.md/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="BNB Greenfield and the Evolution of Decentralized Computing Platforms" /><published>2023-05-04T15:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-05-04T15:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://stantonwong.com/posts/bnb-greenfield-and-the-evolution-of-decentralized-computing-platforms.md/</id> <content src="https://stantonwong.com/posts/bnb-greenfield-and-the-evolution-of-decentralized-computing-platforms.md/" /> <author> <name>Stanton Wong</name> </author> <category term="Crypto" /> <summary> With the recent launch of BNB Greenfield, there was an invitation to write about it via the Greenfield Content Writing Contest (unfortunate that the contest seems to have disappeared, with all the websites supporting the contest having gone down and I have been ghosted as to where I stand, but might as well share here!). As decentralized services have always been a big interest of mine, I took... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Green Bonds need Trustworthy and Accessible Data</title><link href="https://stantonwong.com/posts/green-bonds-need-trustworthy-and-accessble-data/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Green Bonds need Trustworthy and Accessible Data" /><published>2022-05-23T15:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2022-05-24T03:41:04+00:00</updated> <id>https://stantonwong.com/posts/green-bonds-need-trustworthy-and-accessble-data/</id> <content src="https://stantonwong.com/posts/green-bonds-need-trustworthy-and-accessble-data/" /> <author> <name>Stanton Wong</name> </author> <category term="Sustainability" /> <category term="Real Estate" /> <summary> Green bonds are going to be a big deal. We are very well on our way towards a world where many people care about environmental sustainability, climate change, and carbon, and it becomes very obvious when traditional money starts moving heavily towards investing in technologies and companies that fit within this new worldview. In real estate, this is coming in the form of green bonds. So wha... </summary> </entry> </feed>
